        Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood. If you're reading this because you think you might be one, my advise is:
        Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about your birth, and try to lead a normal life.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
        Being a half-blood is dangerous. It's scary. Most of the time, it gets you killed in painful, nasty ways.
        If you're a normal kid, reading this because you think it's fiction, great. Read on.
        I envy you for being able to believe that none of this ever happened.
      </p>

        But if you recognize yourself in these pages--if you feel something stirring inside--stop reading immediately.
        You might be one of us. And once you know that, it's only a matter of time before they sense it too,
        and they'll come for you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
